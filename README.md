# Wildlands League - Ecosystem Services & Carbon Product Development

## 🌲 Project Overview
This repository contains the geospatial analysis and carbon assessment tools for the Wildlands League ecosystem services project. The project aims to transition away from conventional logging by generating income through ecosystem services, specifically carbon credit development and marketing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify protected vs. non-protected areas
- Evaluate deforestation history
- Establish spatial baseline for carbon certification
- Support decision-making on economic viability
- Guide selection of appropriate carbon standards
