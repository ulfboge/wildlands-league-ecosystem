# Wildlands League - Ecosystem Services & Carbon Product Development

## 🌲 Project Overview
This repository contains the geospatial analysis and carbon assessment tools for the Wildlands League ecosystem services project. The project aims to transition away from conventional logging by generating income through ecosystem services, specifically carbon credit development and marketing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify protected vs. non-protected areas
- Evaluate deforestation history (2000-2023)
- Establish spatial baseline for carbon certification
- Support decision-making on economic viability
- Guide selection of appropriate carbon standards

## 📊 Current Progress
### Pre-Assessment Package (Completed)
- Historical land-use analysis (2000-2023)
- Deforestation trends and patterns
- Initial feasibility assessment
- Forest cover analysis using GLAD and Hansen datasets

### Carbon Forest Mapping (In Progress)
- Detailed forest classification
- Forest dynamics analysis
- Disturbance pattern mapping
- Carbon stock assessment

### Upcoming Work
- Reference area analysis
- Infrastructure assessment
- Carbon certification strategy
- Economic analysis
