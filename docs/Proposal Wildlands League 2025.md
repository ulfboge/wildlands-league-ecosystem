# **Proposal: Assessing the Potential for Ecosystem Services & Carbon Product Development** {#proposal:-assessing-the-potential-for-ecosystem-services-&-carbon-product-development}

## **Introduction** {#introduction}

The area of interest is intended for sustainable development, aiming to transition away from conventional logging by generating income through ecosystem services—specifically carbon credit development and marketing. To achieve this, a comprehensive geospatial assessment is required to determine the feasibility of ecosystem service products, evaluate deforestation history, and establish baseline conditions for carbon certification.

Carbon certification follows different methodologies, including **Verra, Gold Standard, and FSC Ecosystem Services tools**, each with distinct requirements. Choosing a standard depends on multiple factors, such as **market demand for specific carbon credit types, land conditions, and alignment with planned land management practices**. Some methodologies focus on avoided deforestation, while others emphasize improved forest management. However, all require a **geospatial baseline study** as a foundation for carbon project development.

The key objectives of this assessment are:

* Identifying the **extent of protected vs. non-protected areas**  
* Evaluating **deforestation history** to determine potential for **additional carbon sequestration**, not merely compensating logging but creating new carbon stocks  
* Establishing a **spatial baseline** to support decision-making on economic viability, selection of the most suitable carbon standard, and future certification processes

The results of this assessment will serve as the basis for future project planning, stakeholder engagement, and investment attraction.

## **Decision-Making & Long-Term Impact** {#decision-making-&-long-term-impact}

The geospatial data generated from this assessment will serve as a **critical input for future project decisions**, including:

* **Economic Viability** – Determining whether ecosystem service development is financially sustainable  
* **Carbon Standard Selection** – Aligning the project with the most suitable certification methodology (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard, FSC Ecosystem Services)  
* **Certification Process** – Reusing baseline data for official carbon credit certification

By establishing a strong data foundation, we enable informed decision-making and set the stage for a **sustainable alternative to conventional logging**, unlocking long-term environmental and economic benefits.

For further details or consultation, please reach out. Let’s collaborate to create meaningful, nature-based solutions.
