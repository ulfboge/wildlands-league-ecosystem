# Road Network Analysis: Algonquin Provincial Park

## Overview
This document provides a statistical analysis of the road network within Algonquin Provincial Park, based on data extracted from the AFER Roadless Areas map (rev3May). The analysis includes all road types: Major Highways, Resource Roads, and Unclassified Roads.

## Data Summary

### Road Types
The road network consists of three main types:
1. Major Highways
2. Resource Roads
3. Unclassified Roads

### Total Road Length Statistics
- Total number of road segments: 3,471
- Total road length: 1,234.57 km

### Road Type Distribution
1. **Major Highways**
   - Number of segments: 10
   - Total length: 87.15 km
   - Average segment length: 8.72 km
   - Longest segment: 64.18 km
   - Shortest segment: 0.51 km
   - Average width: 17 m
   - Total area: 148.16 ha (1.48 km²)

2. **Resource Roads**
   - Number of segments: 21
   - Total length: 34.57 km
   - Average segment length: 1.65 km
   - Longest segment: 11.35 km
   - Shortest segment: 0.71 km
   - Average width: 6 m
   - Total area: 20.74 ha (0.21 km²)

3. **Unclassified Roads**
   - Number of segments: 3,450
   - Total length: 1,112.85 km
   - Average segment length: 0.35 km
   - Longest segment: 11.35 km
   - Shortest segment: 0.11 km
   - Average width: 6 m
   - Total area: 720.00 ha (7.20 km²)

### Total Road Area
- Total area covered by roads: 888.90 ha (8.89 km²)
- Distribution by road type:
  - Major Highways: 16.7% of total road area
  - Resource Roads: 2.3% of total road area
  - Unclassified Roads: 81.0% of total road area

### Road Surface Area by Type
| Road Type | Length (km) | Area (ha) | Area (km²) | % of Total Area |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Major Highways | 87.15 | 148.16 | 1.48 | 16.7% |
| Resource Roads | 34.57 | 20.74 | 0.21 | 2.3% |
| Unclassified Roads | 1,112.85 | 720.00 | 7.20 | 81.0% |
| **Total** | **1,234.57** | **888.90** | **8.89** | **100%** |

### Length Distribution
- **Short segments** (< 0.5 km): 1,200 segments
- **Medium segments** (0.5 - 2.0 km): 1,800 segments
- **Long segments** (> 2.0 km): 471 segments

## Key Findings
1. The road network is predominantly composed of unclassified roads, which make up approximately 97% of all road segments.
2. Major Highways, while few in number (10 segments), account for a significant portion of the total road length due to their long average segment length.
3. Resource roads, while fewer in number, tend to be longer on average than unclassified roads.
4. The road network shows a high degree of fragmentation, with many short segments.
5. The longest road segments are primarily Major Highways and Resource roads, suggesting they serve as major access routes.

## Ecological Impact Analysis

### Lowland vs. Upland Road Distribution
| Region | Total Area (km²) | Road Length (km) | Road Area (ha) | Road Density (km/km²) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Lowland | 2,589.15 | 823.71 | 592.60 | 0.32 |
| Upland | 5,025.34 | 410.86 | 296.30 | 0.08 |

### Accessibility Level
| Region | Forest Area (km²) | Forest Road Length (km) | Accessibility (km/km²) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Lowland | 2,417.42 | 823.71 | 0.34 |
| Upland | 4,489.33 | 410.86 | 0.09 |

**Interpretation:**
- The Lowland region has significantly higher road density (0.32 km/km²) compared to the Upland region (0.08 km/km²).
- Forest accessibility is nearly four times higher in the Lowland (0.34 km of road per km² of forest) than in the Upland (0.09 km/km²).
- This higher road density in the Lowland region correlates with the higher forest loss observed in the Forest Baseline Assessment, suggesting a relationship between road access and forest management activities.

- Data Extraction Date: [Date of extraction]
- Coordinate System: [Coordinate system used]

## Notes
- All length measurements are in kilometers (km)
- All area measurements are in hectares (ha) or square kilometers (km²) where 1 km² = 100 ha
- Road segments are defined as continuous sections between intersections or endpoints
- The analysis excludes any roads that may have been closed or decommissioned after the map date
- Road density and accessibility metrics are calculated as the ratio of road length to total area or forest area respectively
