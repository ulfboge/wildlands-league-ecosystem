# Analysis Methodology

## 1. Pre-Assessment Package
### Historical Land-use Analysis
- **Data sources:** 
  - Hansen Global Forest Change v1.11 (2000-2023)
  - GLAD Forest Type Classification (2000-2020)
- **Time period:** 2000-2023
- **Resolution:** 30m
- **Forest definition (Canadian Standard):**
  - Minimum canopy cover: 25%
  - Minimum area: 1 hectare
  - Minimum height potential: 5 meters
- **Analysis steps:**
  1. Download and preprocess Hansen and GLAD data
  2. Apply Canadian forest definition to both datasets
  3. Calculate annual forest loss (2001-2023)
  4. Generate trend analysis
  5. Produce deforestation maps
  6. Analyze forest dynamics (loss, gain, disturbance)
